# Vehicle-Insurance-Fraud-Detection-POWER-BI--EDA


This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on vehicle insurance claim data to identify patterns and insights related to fraudulent claims. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was developed to analyze fraud trends across multiple dimensions such as policyholder demographics, vehicle characteristics, policy types, and claim details.

The dashboard provides key metrics including total claims, fraudulent claims, and fraud rate, along with visual breakdowns by age, gender, marital status, vehicle make, vehicle age, and policy coverage. Interactive filters enable users to drill down into specific segments to better understand high-risk profiles and fraud-prone scenarios.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and data visualization using Power BI, and serves as an analytical foundation for building advanced fraud detection and predictive models in the future.

Tools & Technologies: Power BI, DAX, Excel
Project Type: Internship / Academic Project
